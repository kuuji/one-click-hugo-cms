      Our names are Mathew Jacob and Sae Byeon, and we are the makers at SKOA, a
      Toronto-based music production studio. We have been consistently
      developing our unique portfolio of music, pushing for all genres,
      emotions, textures.  


      We love creating original soundscapes for films, animations, video games, podcasts and other medias to bring the right atmosphere for your contents. Let us know what you have in mind - we will help you tell your stories.
