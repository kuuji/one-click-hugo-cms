    text: SKOA is a Toronto-based sound studio run by Mathew Jacob & Sae Byeon. We
      create music spanning over a variety of genres including Rock, Jazz,
      textural ambience and orchestral arrangements. With our multi-cultural and
      multi-instrumental backgrounds, we are able to bring a diverse set of
      ideas to the creative process. We are some kind of artists who are always
      looking for various formats of art that when put together with our music
      increases our expression. Above all, we are your kind of artists and would
      love to join you in your journey to create original sounding expressions!
